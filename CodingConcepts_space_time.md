<u>*Space and Time Complexity of Top Coding Interview Concepts *</u>

*Sliding Window:*
Time Complexity - O(n)
Involves iterating through each element of the array or string once.

Space Complexity - If you're only storing a fixed number of variables or a fixed-size data structure (like arrays or fixed-size maps), the space complexity can be  𝑂 (1) O(1) or  𝑂 (𝑘) O(k), where  k is a constant.

If you're using additional data structures like hash maps or sets to track elements within the window, the space complexity can be O(n)

*Binary Search:*
Time Complexity - Average: O(log n) Best: O(1) if mid is target

Space Complexity - Iterative O(1) Recursive: O(log n)

*BFS & DFS:*
Time Complexity (Graph) - O(V + E)
Space Complexity - O(h)
V = number of vertices (nodes)
E = number of edges
h = height of the tree

Time Complexity (2D Matrix) - O(m * n)
m = number of rows
n = number of columns

Time Complexity (Trees) - O (V)
V = number of nodes

*HashMaps*
Operations  Time Complexity
search()    O(1)
insert()    O(1)
remove()    O(1)
